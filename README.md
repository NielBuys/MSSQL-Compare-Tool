# MSSQL-Compare-Tool
<br>
This tool will compare 2 tables one way, during the run it will create sql scripts of all the changes to all the fields in the selected table. Both tables should have the same structure during the run. Insert and Update query's are created during the run and can be saved for later execution.<br>
<br>
Joins can be added to the from query if only certain records should be compared, as long as the end result only have the current table fields visible.<br>
